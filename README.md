# cVation-intro-repo 
a test repo to go through all i have learned through the last couple of weeks. 

The repo should end up containing: 
- Docker image 
- Terraform creating necessary resources in Azure 
- Github actions 
  - Build necessary resources in Azure with Terraform 
  - Build and Deploy Docker image to Azure 
  - Test Docker image with Trivy and show report in security tab 

Further expansion of the project should be 
- Add dummy project to the docker container 
- Deploy dummy project to Azure 
- Enable DependaBot 
- Enable other security measures
